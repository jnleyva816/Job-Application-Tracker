## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing to the project's codebase, documentation, or discussions

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: [Provide contact email if available]
- **GitHub Issues**: For public reporting (when appropriate)
- **GitHub Discussions**: For community-wide discussions about conduct

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please follow these steps:

### 1. Direct Communication (Optional)

If you feel safe doing so, you may choose to address the behavior directly with the person involved. Sometimes people are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and a direct conversation can resolve the issue.

### 2. Report to Community Leaders

If direct communication is not appropriate or effective, please report the incident to community leaders through:

- **Private message** to project maintainers
- **Email** to designated conduct contacts
- **Confidential issue** on GitHub (if applicable)

### 3. Information to Include

When reporting, please include:

- **Your contact information** (so we can follow up)
- **Details about the incident** (what happened, when, where)
- **Any supporting documentation** (screenshots, links, etc.)
- **Impact on you or others**
- **Any previous attempts to resolve** the issue

### 4. What Happens Next

- You will receive acknowledgment of your report within 24-48 hours
- The report will be investigated thoroughly and confidentially
- You will be updated on the progress and outcome
- Your privacy will be protected throughout the process
